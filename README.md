# Object-Counter-using-LDR
This project has two modules, first one is known as “Object counter” and second module is known as “Automatic room light controller”. Main concept behind this project is known as “Object counter” which measures the number of persons entering in any room like seminar hall, conference room, hotel rooms. Here Arduino receives the signals from the sensors, and this signal is operated under the control of software which is stored in the ROM. LCD display placed outside the room displays this value of person count. This person count will be incremented if somebody enters inside the room and at that time lights are turned on. And in reverse way, person count will be decremented if somebody leaves the room. When number of persons inside the room is zero, lights inside the room are turned off.
